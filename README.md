# Olympic-Medal-Wining-Prediction

This repository contains the code and data for a machine learning project predicting the number of medals different teams will win in the Olympics.

## Project Summary

This project aims to develop a model that can predict the number of medals (gold, silver, bronze) a team will win based on various factors such as historical performance, athlete data, training resources, and other relevant features. 

## Data Description

The dataset used for this project contains information about different teams participating in the Olympics. This includes features like:

* Team name
* Historical medal count (gold, silver, bronze)
* Athlete data (e.g., number of athletes, average age, training hours)
* Training resources (e.g., funding, facilities)
* Other relevant factors

## Code Structure

The code is organized into the following directories:

* **data**: Contains the downloaded and preprocessed Olympic dataset.
* **models**: Houses the implementation of different machine learning models for medal prediction.
* **evaluation**: Provides scripts for evaluating the performance of the trained models.
* **visualization**: Contains code for generating visualizations of the data and model results.
* **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - The `data` directory contains scripts for downloading and preprocessing the dataset.
    - You may need to modify these scripts depending on the specific data source and format.

2. **Model Training**:
    - The `models` directory contains implementations of various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
    - Each model has a separate script for training and saving the model.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
    - The `evaluation` directory provides scripts for evaluating the performance of the trained models using metrics like mean squared error and R-squared.

4. **Visualization**:
    - The `visualization` directory contains code for generating visualizations of the data and model results.
    - These visualizations can help in understanding the relationships between features and medal count.
